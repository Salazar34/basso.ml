            Eagle 360 it's an advanced security AI system that aims to protect
            every corner of the city. It is based on the collaboration between
            citizens and guards, allowing to keep an eye on the territory in a
            more effcient way. <br />
            <br />
            By implementing a system of hidden cameras all around the city
            police officers can watch over for criminality and other kind of
            stuff. The application will also provide an interactive map which
            will be updated periodically, so it can also work as an infocenter
            for foreigners.

          As our primary priority we want to preserve the life of our citizens
          by creating a secure environment within our cities, in order to
          guarantee the best life for everyone. We belive that the most powerful
          weapon we can use to fight criminality, violations and theft is engaging
          all the citizens in the city security program, with the aim of helping
          the CSB to supervise all over the city.
